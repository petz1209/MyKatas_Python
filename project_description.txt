Welcome to the Song Manager App.

This App is a songs library for our users.
It allows the users to upload new songs, get all their songs or just a single one and also
to serialize (reformat) a song based on their preferred format.

This App was originally written as a prototype, so there wasn't any emphasis clean code or structure.
However, due to the growing popularity our Management has asked for additional features. But since
Bob, the developer who created this project, is retired, we cannot seem to figure out how this thing works.
Therefor nobody wants to touch the code and management is getting a bit annoyed.
I guess it is time to clean up the code base. We think you are the developer to do so.

take a look at the code from scratch. At first, don't bother with implementing new features. Focus only
on refactoring the code.

The goals of your refactoring are:
- divide business logic data and client views
- increase coherence and reduce coupling in to lighten the job of adding new features

the code is in src/original_code.py
Best of luck
